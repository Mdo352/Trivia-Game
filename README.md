# Trivia-Game

## About This Project
This trivia game was created as an assignment for a UNH Coding Bootcamp.
You have 15 seconds to answer all og the questions. When you click the submit button or time out of the question,
The number of answers you get correct will be shown to you after you complete the final question.
this project helped me further my grasp on dynamically create elements with javascript/jQuery. As well as using timers/asynchronous.

## Tasks to complete
- [x] clear out the div after the last quesion
- [ ] add sound whether or not you get the quesion correct
- [ ] stop the counter from running after the final quesion
- [ ] append the final score into the empty #questionContainer div
- [ ] add more questions to the list of object questions
- [ ] randomize the order that questions and radio inputs show populate each time
